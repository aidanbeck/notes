### Code Demo
- walk through your project
- explain functionality
- discuss technical details
- explain not just how, but why
useful for collaboration, learning, and interviews.


### Structuring Your Code Demo

The Project Overview
- describe purpose
- highlight key features/requirements
- be brief and concise

Demonstrate Key Features
