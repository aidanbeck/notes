==== Tell Your Story ====

Tech Resume Differences
- bridge between past experiences and a future in tech
- traditional resumes focus on work history
- tell a story of transformation & capability
- companies want what you can learn and do


# Four Pillars

Summary Statement
- story in three sentances
- brief & concise 
- acknowledge & connect the past
- showcase present skills
- point to the future
```
"Former high school mathematics teacher with 5 years of experience
breaking down complex concepts for diverse learners. Recently completed
intensive software development training with proficiency in Java, Spring
Boot, and React. Seeking to combine educational background with new
technical skills to build intuitive user experiences as a junior developer."
```

Technical Skills Section
- list of skills
- quality over quantity
- be confident in each

Project Section
- your substitute for years of experience
- well described project > vague description of experience
- describe like a journalist. What? How? Why? Impact?
```
