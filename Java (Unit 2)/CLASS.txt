==== Classes & Objects ====

# Methods
- blocks of code
- perform specific tasks
- break program into manageable pieces
- (a method is a function that is part of an object or class. In Java, everything is an object or class.)
- take input **parameters**
- return **values**
- `void` is a type that allows a method to not return anything.
```
public static void printMessage(string message) {
 System.out.println(message);
} // has no return
```
- a return is needed otherwise (fact check this).
