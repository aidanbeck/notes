==== Classes & Objects ====

# Methods
- blocks of code
- perform specific tasks
- break program into manageable pieces
- (a method is a function that is part of an object or class. In Java, everything is an object or class.)
- take input **parameters**
- return **values**
- `void` is a type that allows a method to not return anything.
```
public static void printMessage(string message) {
 System.out.println(message);
} // has no return
```
- a return is needed otherwise (fact check this).

==== Composite Data Types ====
- a type made up of other types

Simple Public Data Classes
- in Java, a new file is made for each class defined
- the file & class name should match
Person.java
```
public class Person {
 public String name;
 public int age;
 public String address;
}
```
- person is a composite data type, as it includes multiple type fields.
- a new object is defined with the `new` keyword and it's class name.
- `Person bob = new Person();`
- classes can also be composed within classes.
- creating public fields is not actually best practice, as encapsulation should be used.
