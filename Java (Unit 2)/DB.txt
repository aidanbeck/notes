==== An Introduction to Databases ====

Database:
- persistent storage systems
- store & retrieve information

The Role of Databases
- Front End: what the user interacts with
- Back End: application that runs on the server
- Database: part of the application that stores data
 - typically in a structured and indexed format
 - securely stores data

Database First Vs Code First
- Database First
 - first create db
 - then generate code to interact with db
 - use SQL and MySQL Workbench to create/manage
- Code First
 - write java classes in backend
 - annotate classes with how they should save to the database
 - rely on framework to generate appropriate SQL and manage db

Code First
- most common on the modern web
- builds on Java & OOP
- still uses MySQL Workbench to create an empty db
- (Later we will learn SQL)


# Creating a Database
- Install MySQL Workbench & MySQL server
 - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
 - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
- Open MySQL Workbench
- click "Local instance 3306" to connect to your local server
 - I clicked "don't start on windows startup" when installing the server, how can I start it?
 - Probably in the sql configuration program in my start menu
In The Workbench
- click "Create a new schema in the connected server"
 - enter a name
 - click "apply"
 - click "finish"
 - see your new db in the "SCHEMAS" tab
Congratulations, you've created a database!
We won't add tables to it yet, we will create them with code.
